2. **Add Descriptive Adjectives**: Include words like "vibrant", "dramatic", "detailed", etc.
3. **Mention Medium**: Specify the artistic medium like "oil painting", "watercolor", "digital art", etc.
4. **Combine Styles**: Try mixing different styles for unique results.

## Adjust Parameters for Better Results

Different style targets work better with different strength settings:

- **Subtle Styles** (Pencil sketches, Watercolors): 0.3-0.5 strength
- **Moderate Styles** (Oil paintings, Impressionism): 0.5-0.7 strength
- **Strong Styles** (Cubism, Abstract art, Cyberpunk): 0.7-0.9 strength

## Troubleshooting

If your style isn't being applied effectively:

1. **Increase the Strength**: Try a higher strength value (0.7-0.8)
2. **Be More Specific**: Add more descriptive terms to your prompt
3. **Mention "Style"**: Explicitly include the word "style" or "aesthetic" in your prompt
4. **Try Different Models**: Some styles work better with different models

Remember that some images and styles work better than others. Experimentation is key to finding the best results!
